[Overcommitters Club](https://overcommitters.club/) is a joke but also kind of serious side project for people like us who tend to overcommit to things. It's currently live at https://overcommitters.club.

It's built on [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Next](https://nextjs.org/), and uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

Deploys are automatically triggered on every commit, via [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
